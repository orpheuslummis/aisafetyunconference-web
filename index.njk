            <h2>Status</h2>
            <p>NeurIPS is online-only in 2020 and 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The AISAU is designed to be an in-person event, therefore not happening in these years. NeurIPS 2022 is planned to be <a href="https://blog.neurips.cc/2021/07/02/neurips-2021-deadline-extension-2/">in-person in New Orleans</a>. We hope for the unconference to happen then and there.


            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
            The AI Safety and Alignment Unconference brings together persons interested in all aspects of AI safety and alignment, from technical AI safety problems to issues of governance and responsible use of AI, for one day during the NeurIPS week. As an unconference, the event aims to maximize valuable social interactions between participants, through free-form discussions, moderated discussion groups, one-on-ones, and lightning talks.
            </p>
